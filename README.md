## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT
- Express.js
- Node.js
- FRONTEND:HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT
- BACKEND:Node.js,Express.js,body-parser,cors

For Hardware:
- LAPTOP


### ImplementaBackend Implementation:
Set up a basic server using Express in your backend.js (example shown in your code).

Add routes for hospitals, facilities, and bookings as shown in your code:

javascript
Copy
Edit
app.get('/hospitals', (req, res) => { ... });
app.get('/facilities/:type', (req, res) => { ... });
app.post('/book', (req, res) => { ... });
Add logic to handle booking confirmation using bookings.push().

Frontend Implementation:
Create HTML pages and implement form submissions, buttons, and page transitions as done in your frontend code.
Add JavaScript functions like showHospitalsPage(), showHospitalDetails(), etc., to manage page transitions and interactions.
Add search and filter functionality for hospitals and facilities (as implemented in your frontend code).tion

# Installation
Backend Initialization:
Create a new Node.js project (if not already initialized):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm init -y
Install the required dependencies for the backend (Express, CORS, and body-parser):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express cors body-parser
Optional: Install nodemon for auto-reloading the server during development:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev nodemon
Optional: Install Axios (if you plan to use Axios for frontend-backend communication):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install axios
Frontend Initialization:
If you decide to use frontend frameworks (e.g., React or Bootstrap), you can initialize them as follows:

React Initialization (Optional): If you want to set up the frontend with React:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app my-app
Bootstrap Initialization (Optional): If you want to add Bootstrap for styling:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install bootstrap

# Run
Backend (Node.js):
Run the server using nodemon (for auto-reloading):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the server using nodemon, and it will auto-reload when you make changes to your code.

If not using nodemon, run the server with Node.js:

bash
Copy
Edit
node backend.js
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
Since you are not using any specific frontend framework, you can simply open the HTML file in any browser to run the website.

Open the index.html file in your browser directly.
If you are using React for the frontend:

Navigate to the React project folder and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
